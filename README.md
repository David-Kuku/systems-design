# systems-design

This repository contains my designs for various systems. I use this repository to track my progress and share my designs with others.

### Contents
The repository is divided into different systems I'm trying to design which are in turn divided into the following directories:

designs: This directory contains the actual designs for the systems.
notes: This directory contains notes and documentation about the systems.
scripts: This directory contains scripts that I use to test and deploy the systems.
How to Use
To use the repository, you can clone it to your local machine. Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the designs directory and view the designs. You can also open the notes directory to read the documentation.
