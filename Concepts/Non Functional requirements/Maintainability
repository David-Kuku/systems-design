Maintainability can be defined more clearly in close relation to reliability. The only difference between them is the variable of interest. Maintainability refers to time-to-repair, whereas reliability refers to both time-to-repair and the time-to-failure. Combining maintainability and reliability analysis can help us achieve availability, downtime, and uptime insights.
